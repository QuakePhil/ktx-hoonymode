217. CTF changes: u may use "/cmd info runes 1" so server will automatically
	 send to u something like "set rune xxx" where xxx is corresponding rune u have.
	 Useful for tp messages.
	 Also, i've (with Tonik help) add something to mvdsv, so runes/sigils shown in HUD, but u
	 need mvdsv from CVS 4sure.

VVD:
218. Added velocity statistics in final statistics print between weapons and armors + megahealths:

215. CTF changes: on_connect, on_observe, on_enter, on_spec_enter now renamed to
	 on_connect_ctf, on_observe_ctf, on_enter_ctf, on_spec_enter_ctf.

	 siikah request

216. CTF changes: call next aliases "autored" and "autoblue" if u change team to red or blue,
	 also call corresponding aliases at moment of connection, but do not call aliases just on map change.

	 siikah request

qq:
214. Added: "/trx_rec", "/trx_play", "/trx_stop".
	 "/trx_rec" just record few seconds of player model movement in to mod memory,
	 so u can replay movement via "/trx_play", "/trx_stop" is just stop playback/recording.
	 Commands have nothing with real demo recording.
	 U can controll playback speed via "pbspeed" setinfo key, f.e. value 50 will give u
	 50% speed of original. Not so usefull commands, but can help in some cases.
	 In slow motion model is jerking, probably need add interpolation (lerping) someday :)
	 Commands available only during prewar, obvious...

	 idea and partial sources by Tonik

212. Fixing bug, excess muzzleflash.

	 thx B1aze

2006-08-18 [ver 1.33]
qq:
204. Since in ktx u need different values for "ln", "lw", "ls" comparing to ktpro,
	 I made some work around: added "ktpl" key for "/cmd info".
	 So, once u setup "/cmd info ktpl 1" then u do not need to tune "ln", "lw", "ls",
	 they will work equal to ktpro.

205. Added auto executing next alias "ktx_infoset" for player, and "ktx_sinfoset"
	 for spectator. So u can setup some ktx specific things. "infoset" and "sinfoset"
	 still supported.
	
	 So, regarding change #204 u may setup next alias:
	 	alias ktx_infoset "/cmd info ktpl 1"
	 sure if u really need this.

206. "/+wp_stats" layout changed a bit.
	 If u use "/cmd info ktpl 1" then u will always have only one line for 
	 all weapons (ktpro style), otherwise line will be wraped (breaked in few lines)
	 if can't be fully displayed.

207. BUGFIX: settings re-executed on map change even map was the same, nasty bug.

208. Added "/dmgfrags" command, which toggle server cvar "k_dmgfrags"
	 which was added by ult some time ago. Probably command may be usefull for dmm4 games.

	 set k_dmgfrags 0 // 0 - normal frags, 1 - treat given damage as frags(some formula used)

209. Added "/no_lg" command, for lazy one, and "/no_gl" for smart one :|

210. Now /noweapon command understand numbers like "/noweapon 8" equal to "/noweapon lg".

	 i'me forget who suggest this one, let me know and i've add ur nick here %)	 

2006-08-14
qq:
202. WARNING WARNING WARNING: "k_maxrate" removed, use "sv_maxrate" instead.
	 Also mvdsv has "sv_maxdownloadrate", last is just advice.

203. Captains pickup system changed. If we sign first captain as c1 and second as c2
	 then old system looks like this: c1 c2 c1 c2 etc...
	 Now its looks like this: c1 c2 c2 c1 c2 c1 c2 etc...
	 Which captain start picking actually random, so this can be c2 c1 c1 c2 c1 etc...

	 Requested by tom|3tk and hetman, they notice that more fair...

2006-08-13 [ver 1.32]
qq:
201. Added "/iplist" command like in ktpro.
	 Can be controlled via cvar:

	 set k_ip_list 1 // 0 - noone, 1 - reald admins, 2 - elected admins too
					 // 3, 4 - judges which are not supported so ignoreed 
					 // 5 - all players
	 By default is 1.

2006-08-09
qq:
200. Now CTF files will be downloaded only if server actually in "/ctf" mode,
	 but not if just support /ctf but in some other mode like 1on1 2on2 etc...

2006-08-07
qq:
199. Added "/upplayers", "/downplayers", "/upspecs", "/downspecs" like in ktpro.
	 Few server cvars:
	 set k_allowcountchange 1 // 0 - noone, 1 - reald admins, 2 - elected admins too
							  // 3, 4 - judges which are not supported so ignoreed 
							  // 5 - all players
	 By default is 1.

	 set k_maxclients 8 // just set some limit for "/upplayers"
	 By default reflect maxclients from XonX command.

	 set k_maxspectators 4 // just set some limit for "/upspecs"
	 By default reflect maxspectators from XonX command.

	 I think only k_allowcountchange must be set in cfgs if u need such commands.

2006-08-06
qq:
198. Added "/teleteam" command, just change team telefrags behaviour, like in ktpro.
	 For server admins:
	 set k_tp_tele_death 1 // 0 - frags does't affected by team telefrags
						   // 1 - frags affected

	 If variable omited in cfgs, then 1 is used, that a difference with ktpro.
	 I decide use 1 after results of poll on http://quakeworld.nu, so plz don't change it to 0.

2006-08-04
qq:
197. Instead of adding "/cmd ban" to mod i've add it to server, and call this "server side bans".
	 Any mod may be slightly modifed to use server side bans.

	 So if u get mvdsv from cvs and latest ktx, u will have next cmds:
	 "/cmd ban <uid/nick> <time s m h d> [reason]" timed ban by uid/nick.
	 Example: "/cmd ban qqshka 10s testban" will ban user with nick qqshka for 10 seconds, and print reason as "testban".
	 "/cmd banip <ip> <time s m h d>" timed ban by ip.
	 Example: "/cmd ban 127.0.0.1 10s" will ban ip 127.0.0.1 for 10 seconds.
	 "/cmd banrem [banid]" remove ban by banid, banlist can be obtained if you omit banid, so banid can be guessed.

	 ezQuake users may omit cmd and just use "/ban", "/banip" and "/banrem".

2006-07-30
qq:
196. Rewrote a bit impulse handling, as result fixed some issue with "/kfjump".

	 "bugreport" by semi

2006-07-27
qq:
195. Added tie-break overtime like in ktpro, can be accessed like others overtimes via "/overtime".
     Server admins may use "set k_overtime 3" in cfgs for such overtime.

2006-07-18
qq:
194. U can set timelimit 1 or even 0 via "/timedown" now, timelimit 0 require some fraglimit.

2006-07-17
qq:
193. Added "/force_spec" command like in ktpro, but we support params.
	 Examples: 
	 "/force_spec *" will force spec all not ready players.
	 "/force_spec someidler" force spec player with name "someidler", but
	 if "someidler" is already spec, do opposite operation, ie "someidler"
	 will join server as player.
	 Also we support retarded "setinfo fs" from ktpro, read ktpro docs about this if u want know more.
	 Oh, fuh users sure may use "/cmd force_spec [param]".

2006-07-16
qq:
192. Added cvar k_lockmode. Just reflect "/lockmode" command.

	 set k_lockmode 1 // 0 - Server locking off
					  // 1 - Teamlock on - only players in existing teams can connect during game
					  // 2 - Server locked - players cannot connect during game

	 By default if u type usermode command (1on1 2on2 etc...) k_lockmode will be set to 1.
	 So no changes in cfgs needed. But sure server admin may change k_lockmode via cfgs.

2006-07-13
qq:
188. Added support for timelimit 0, but u need setup some fraglimit.

189. Overtime now possible in FFA too.

190. SECURE ISSUE

	 Admin code (6 digit k_admincode) can be found via scripts(direct enumeration) in few hours.
	 So i'm add some fix for that, just adding some waits, so "hacker" will spend much more time to
	 find out pass.

	 NOTE: I'm strongly recommend use alpha numeric k_admincode, yes u will lost possibility 
		   to use impulses to enter admin code, but cmon, use /cmd admin pass

	 thx tom

191. Also Rocket Arena is added to KTX, but in stage of beta, so i describe later how to activate it.

2006-06-29
qq:
187. "/fallbanny" does't requires admin rights for players, specs still requires.

2006-06-27
qq:
186. Some CTF changes.

	 Added modern(q3ish)/modifed CTF mode, i.e. CTF without hook & runes.

	 Players may affect this via commands: "/nohook", "/norunes", "/mctf".
	 But u need activate CTF mode first via "/ctf" command.
	 "/nohook" - toggle hook allowability.
	 "/norunes" - toggle runes allowability.
	 "/mctf" - just turn off runes & hook, most wanted thing?

	 For server admins:
	 	set k_ctf_hook  0 // 0 - hook  off, 1  - on
	 	set k_ctf_runes 0 // 0 - runes off, 1  - on

	 By default, when u type "/ctf" hook & runes is on, if u wanna change this,
	 u must add k_ctf_hook and k_ctf_runes somewhere in cfgs, i think
	 configs/usermodes/ctf/default.cfg is good for this purposes.

2006-06-19
qq:
185. "/fkick" removed. U can use "/cmd kick id/name" or "/mkick id" instead
	 for not fully connected users too.

	 thx gLAd for idea

2006-06-18 [ver 1.31]
qq:
183. New commands: "s-m", "multi", "mmode" like in ktpro.
	 Read "mvdfeatures.txt" from ktpro docs about this commands.

184. IP BASED VIP change.
	 Since "/mmode rcon [pass]" now supported, then
	 VIP with bit 32 - VIP with rcon admin rights, is working now.

	 If u r such vip, u can grant rcon message mode via "/mmode rcon".
	 If u r know server rcon pass, u can grant rcon message mode via "/mmode rcon pass",
	 vip rights is not required in last case.

2006-06-15
qq:
182. Now spectators can see connect/disconnect message about other spectators
	 independatly from match status.

	 thx smerz

2006-06-14
qq:
181. Removed showing vertical speed with sh_speed on.
     Few reasons:
		1) smart commands like impulse 8 7 6 1 does't work cos u may have zero ammo if have zero speed.
		2) make ktx code too compilcated for ppl who noob to ktx sources.
		3) better add some hud to client, ezQuake already have horizontal hud, just add
		   same for vertical hud.

2006-06-07
qq:
180. fixed auto demo recording bug.
	 thx 123 & Tuna

2006-06-05
qq:
177. Commands s-p, s-l, s-r now not commands, but catched from say, like ktpro,
	 but latest mvdsv required!!!

178. s-t from ktpro now supported too.

	 s-t allows you to talk to a team, s-t has 3 predefined teams "player", "spectator" and
	 "admin", but you can also talk to teams present on the server. ktpro (c)

179. Freeze in countdown is restored, but last 0.2 sec instead of 1 sec, like ktpro.
	 I'm not sure is freeze really required, imo not, but I have report what
	 if u have some velocity on countdown u will have velocity on first spawn,
	 i think this is wrong opinion and player just hold/press some buttons
	 before/after respawn.

2006-06-04
qq:
172. Added cvar "k_use_matchless_dir".

	 set k_use_matchless_dir 1 // 1 - use configs/usermodes/matchless instead of
							   //         configs/usermodes/ffa in matchless mode

	 Empezar request

173. +wp_stats show total axe hits instead of percentage :]

174. Teams stats now contain gl hits too, was't added in previos versions cos
	 ktpro does't show this.

175. Teams stats does't show fractional part of weapons effi, save some space
	 for retards who still uses 320x240 :(

ult:
176. Added /swapall command for ctf admins.

2006-06-03
qq:
171. Added cvar "k_defmode".
	 Controll which user mode will be set on server startup or last player disconnect.
	 Also all corresponding configs will be executed.

	 set k_defmode "1on1" // 1on1 - duel
						  // 2on2 3on3 4on4 10on10 - team modes
						  // ffa - free for all
						  // ctf - capture the flag

	 Empezar request

2006-05-31
qq:
168. "/lock" command renamed to "/lockmode".

169. Now command "/lock" and "/cmd lock" lock server for some short time.
     Non vip players can't connect during this time. 
	 Specs not affected by this command.

170. IP BASED VIP change.
	 Vip with bit 2 - not kickable VIP by elected admins, is working now.

	 NOTES:
	 1) such VIP can't be kicked by elected admin, real admin still can kick them
	 2) such VIP can be kicked by forcestart, idlebot, floodprotect, etc...

2006-05-27 [ver 1.30]

2006-05-26
qq:
165. Removed player freeze at last countdown second.
     Hope this does't cause some troubles.

vvd:
166. Now in prewar with sh_speed on (/kinfo kf 64) weapons ammo show vertical speed:
	 shells		= velocity / 1000;
	 nails		= velocity % 1000 / 100;
	 rockets	= velocity %  100 / 10;
	 cells		= velocity %   10;

2006-05-25
qq:
159. Now "k_remove_end_hurt" also remove trigger_changelevel ( exit thing which
	 kill u instantly ) on map end, so variable have now additional value.

	 set k_remove_end_hurt 1 // 0 - do not remove hurt/changelevel from map end
							 // 1 - remove hurt and changelevel triggers
							 // 2 - remove only hurt trigger, compatibility with krpto

	 Suggested by Drugs-Bunny.

160. Changed output from "/gren_mode" a bit.

161. Ktproish duel end game no-armor output.

	 u can access this command via "/cmd dlist" as well. Working as
	 redirect to mvdsv "/cmd demolist".

157. Added command "/dinfo <demonum>", just redirect to mvdsv "/cmd demoinfo".

2006-05-17
qq:
153. I'm patch mvdsv so now qvm mods may handle say/say_team internally and
	 now KTX may handle say/say_team too, but as u understand this require
	 mvdsv from CVS. In future this allow me add things like
	 ktpro "/cmd silence", "/cmd mmode", etc.

	 Added command "fp" like in ktpro (c), just toggle flood protect levels.

	 U can control flood level via next cvar "k_fp" like in ktpro.

	 set k_fp 1  //floodprot level 1 [9 1 1]: 2 - [4 1 5]: 3 - [5 3 7]
                 //1 - after 9 messages per 1 second silence for 1 sec. etc

	 Toggle grenades mode: "Grenades explode after a while or on direct impact" vs 
						   "Grenades only explode on direct impact".
	 Work only in dmm4.

	 Added cvar "k_dmm4_gren_mode".

	 set k_dmm4_gren_mode 0 // 0 - default
							// 1 - explode only on direct impact

152. Added command "toggleready". ktpro (c). Just toggle ready.
	 NOTES: blaps must be happy :>.

2006-05-13 [ver 1.29]
qq:
148. Added cvar "k_demo_mintime".
	
	 set k_demo_mintime 120 // keep server demo even match is broken for some reason
							// (/break /forcebreak etc) if enough time spend.

2006-05-08
qq:
140. Changed/ktpro'ish how mod assign names for demos:

	 duel_dag_vs_zu-zu[dm3] // duel game
	 2on2_no!_vs_fom[dm3]   // team 2on2 game, same for 3on3 4on4 etc..
	 team_no!_vs_fom[dm3]   // unknown team game
	 ctf_no!_vs_fom[dm3]    // ctf game
	 ffa_10[dm3]            // ffa game, where 10 is count of players
	 unknown_10[dm3]        // unknown game, where 10 is count of players

141. Added per player powerups stats if team game.

142. Spawnfrag counted now if u kill someone in 2 seconds after he spawn.

qq:
139. Added new variable "k_sayteam_to_spec".
	 New variable now available in _latest_ mvdsv, "sv_sayteam_to_spec" which controll send
	 say_team msgs to specs or not, at the same time mod need some manipulations with this,
	 for example some admins may wanna turn off sending say_team to specs when match is not in
	 progress since players may talk about tactics etc, but specs really need say_team during
	 match. So mod can switch value of "sv_sayteam_to_spec" dependant of is match going on or not.

	 set k_sayteam_to_spec 1 // 0 - sv_sayteam_to_spec always set to 0
	                         // 1 - set sv_sayteam_to_spec to 0 in non match and to 1 in match
	                         // 2 - set sv_sayteam_to_spec to 1 in non match and to 0 in match
	                         // 3 - sv_sayteam_to_spec always set to 1

	 Aslo same fixage for +scores.

2006-05-05
qq:
131. Now mod in matchless mode wait players before start match, thx mli.

132. Fixed bug where after no players left and configs/reset.cfg is invoked mod still remember
	 last XonX command and auto invoke XonX on map change because reset.cfg in most cases
	 contain some map change, also mod foget about last XonX with "reset" command.

130. Added command "time", show time at server host.

2006-05-04
qq:
129. Added command floodprot. ktpro (c)

	set k_cmd_fp_count 10   // 10 commands allowed ..
	set k_cmd_fp_per 4      // per 4 seconds
	set k_cmd_fp_for 5      // skip commands for 5 seconds
	set k_cmd_fp_kick 4     // kick after 4 warings
	set k_cmd_fp_dontkick 0 // if 1 - don't use kick
	set k_cmd_fp_disabled 0 // if 1 - don't use cmd floodprot

	By default values are: 10, 4, 5, 4, 0, 0, so no need for edditing cfg.

2006-05-03
vvd:
128. Added new command sh_speed work like it was in ktpro.

2006-04-30 [ver 1.27]
qq:  
124. I made some fix to mod, so now fuhQuake/mqwcl users will be happy.

	 As u may know aliases with params supported by ezQuake only. fuhQuake, mqwcl and Zquake
	 does't support such aliases. ezQuake users may use for example "/rnd dm6 dm4",
	 other clients users can't do this, they must do "/cmd rnd dm4 dm6" instead, in previous
	 versions of KTX they must use "/cmd cc rnd dm4 dm6" and this "cc" was ugly and uncompatible
	 with ktpro.

	 NOTES: kinfo  = /cmd kinfo  = /cmd info,  last saved for compatibility with ktpro
			kuinfo = /cmd kuinfo = /cmd uinfo, last saved for compatibility with ktpro

2006-04-29
ult:
123. Added took and killed rl stats
	   took: player took rl and did not already have one
	 killed: killed enemy who had rl (they do not have to be using it)

	 Players can no longer change bottomcolor during ctf (must be red or blue)

2006-04-27
ult:
122. Added new end of game stat: dropped rls
     Added captures and flag defends to top scores (ctf only)
     Team stats now displayed after invididual stats (looks better due to long length of individual stats)
     Enhanced ctf flag defend logic
     Fixed frags, efficiency, and rank stats for ctf

2006-04-25
121. Added commands: s-p, s-r, s-l. ktpro (c)

	 ------------------
	 s-p <name/id> txt
	 ------------------
	 s-p allows you to talk to a single player/spectator.

	 examples: s-p 2 test
               s-p name test

	 --------
	 s-r txt
	 --------
	 s-r allows you to directly reply to the person who directly spoke with you.
	 s-r message format is [sender->]: txt

	 s-l allows you to talk to the person again you last spoke with.
	 s-l message format is [sender->]: txt
	 example: s-l test

	 NOTES: this is a real commands, in ktpro this was "say" command extension/hack.

2006-04-24 [ver 1.26]
120. Added commands: infolock, infospec, moreinfo. ktpro (c)

	 infospec - toggle show spec info to specs or not.
	 infolock - toggle send info to admined/all specs.
	 moreinfo - the spectators can choose to receive additional information about 
				the game, for example who took which powerup, who took a rocket launcher etc. 
				There are different settings that determine which information you will receive, 
				for example "powerups only", "powerups and armors" etc. ktpro (c)

	 NOTE: instead of "moreinfo" u may use "cmd info mi <level>", where level from 0 to 4.

	 Server admins may toggle this via:

	 set k_spec_info 1    //bit mask - you must add values to define proper action
                          // 1 - spec info showed to specs
						  // 2 - spec info sended only to admined specs
						  // so 1+2 = 3 this mean spec info on but sended only to admined specs

2006-04-23
119. Temporally removed commands: forcepause, unpause, and removed possibility to autokpause
	 when someone is timing. I do this because server does't have native pause which i can invoke
	 from mod, k_pause is ugly hack which never became safe. So wait untill someone made
	 native server pause and some API for mod.

2006-04-22
118. I rewrote command "commands" so it looks really nice now :>

2006-04-20 [ver 1.25]
117. Fixed my'n bug with new code about setinfo, thx ult.

2006-04-19 [ver 1.24]
116. Since we remove "k_srvcfgmap" we need somehow set different settings for different map
	 in ffa matchless mode. So now in matchless mode "ffa" command invoked by server automatically 
	 every map change(to another map), but this is does't showed to players, but server admins
	 must to know about this.

2006-04-19 [ver 1.23]
115. Fixed bug with hostname in matchless mode, thx gLAd.

2006-04-18
114. Added aliases: on_enter, on_connect, on_matchstart, on_matchend, on_matchbreak,
				    on_admin, on_unadmin.

	 This aliases turned on/off via "cmd info kf" and via "cmd info ev".

	 I put documentation later, but for now u can read setinfos.txt from ktpro docs.

2006-04-16
113. Added support for Reliable Weapons from ktpro.
	 "cmd wreg [[char] [[+/-]weapon order]]" i.e like it was for ktpro (c)
	 Seems this ktpro feature useless/unpopular now, but added for compatibility with ktpro.

2006-04-12
ult:

111. Added new functionality for k_dis.  k_dis 2 enables discharges, but only damages players actually in the liquid.
	 This is default for ctf.

112. Added ctf items to e2m2 and e4m3.  Swedes can thank me later.

2006-04-11 [ver 1.22]
108. Fixed bug with infinite loop if u disable all weapons with noweapons and invoke impulse 10.

109. WARNING: ult, added basic CTF support.
     Since CTF uses some additional media files (few models and sounds) u may need it too.
     Grab it here http://www.quakeworld.us/ult/ctf/pak0.pak  (only 300kb).
	
	 Added "set k_ctf_custom_models".

	 set k_ctf_custom_models 0 // 0 - do not usage CTF models, use some models from 
							   //     original quake1 data files.
							   // 1 - use nice CTF models, u can grab it via link above.
							   //     If u are server admin, in this case u need put this pak0.pak
							   //     it KTX directory and allow download models.

	 Server config changes:
		1) add 64 to "k_allowed_free_modes" to enable ctf, 127 now enables all modes
		2) "set k_mode 4" if you want server to default to ctf mode and add 64
		   to "k_allowed_free_modes".

	 NOTES: 
		1) if u are server admin, and do _not_ want CTF and this files, just do _not_ add 64
			to "k_allowed_free_modes".
		2) if u are server admin, and _want_ CTF, just add 64 to "k_allowed_free_modes",
			put pak0.pak in KTX directory and put "set k_ctf_custom_models 1" in server.cfg.
		3) CTF is still in developing stage, so i'm not recommend turn it on for now, but u can
			help us if u find bugs etc...

110. Now MOTD less egocentric :>

2006-04-08
107. Fixed small issue so damage in prewar in statusbar is shown more like it was in ktpro.

2006-04-07
106. Added "set k_no_fps_physics", players can play with 15 or 300 fps and jumping like with 77.
	 U _must_ understand, this feauture affect only how high u can jump, but trajectory
	 will be not the same if u use 77 and 500 fps (if server allow this 500 fps), i think so.

	 set k_no_fps_physics 0 // 0 - fps value does't affect how high u can jump
							// 1 - fps value affect how high u can jump

	 So, recommended set this to 0.

2006-04-06 [ver 1.21]
105. Just changed version and some fixes.

2006-04-04
104. Added /agree command, u just agrees on/to last voted map.

2006-04-02
102. Fixed k_spectalk vs fpd bug.

103. Added /rnd <1st 2nd ...> command. ktpro (c)
	 This will choose one item from a set of items and publically announce which one was
	 chosen, so this command can be used to find a random map for example.

2006-04-01 [ver 1.20]
101. Removed k_srvcfgmap, instead of this, XonX command called every time u switch to another map.
     If u just reload map, XonX command is not invoked. We think this is better than type XonX
	 every time u cnange map to another, so u can't forget about powerups and etc. So, once
	 u connect to server, type appropriate XonX command and u can forget about server settings
	 if u change map and server is _well_ configured.

2006-03-31 [ver 1.19]
100. Added /lastscores command.

2006-03-28 [ver 1.18]
 98. Save colors for ghosts now, set ping to 39, so average ping is calc a bit better?

 99. Now play sounds for specs while countdown.

2006-03-26 [ver 1.17]
 96. Now ghosts is shown via client commands like this: +showscores +showteamscores.

 97. Command /klist show ghosts too.

2006-03-25 [ver 1.16]
 92. Removed "k_deathmsg" and related stuff, now custom death messages is by default.

 93. Now "stomp death" is more ktpro-like.

 94. Now teleport sound is instant - no more this 200 ms delay.

 95. Added "set dmm4_invinc_time" - invincible time for dmm4, set to -1 to disabled invincible.

	 set dmm4_invinc_time 0.5 // this set invincible for 0.5 of second
	 set dmm4_invinc_time 0   // this set invincible for 2 seconds, since 2 seconds is default
	 set dmm4_invinc_time -1  // this turn off invincible

2006-03-24 [ver 1.15]
 89. Now if u change team during game u are not kicked but warned.

 90. /who /whonot /whoskin /list commands look better now.
     /list command is now available for admined spec.

 91. Fixed ugly head bounce, when player gibbed.

2006-03-23 [ver 1.14]
 88. Fixed some captain related bugs.

2006-03-22 
 86. Removed sets: k_umfallbunny, rj, axe.

 87. /tkfjump and /tkrjump now admin commands only.

2006-03-19 [ver 1.12]
 85. WARNING
	 WARNING
	 WARNING: i convert all localinfos to sets, so u need update configs, 
	 		  u just must search "localinfo" and replace with "set".

	 Only one exceptioan i think, custom map list is still in localinfo, i'm talking something
	 about like this:

	 localinfo 1000 ukooldm1
	 localinfo 1001 ukooldm2
	 localinfo 1002 ukooldm3

	 this still legal, because of mvdsv is doing some things with this localinfos.

	 And, about FFA, localinfo k_ml_0 k_ml_1 ... is converted to set too, u are warned!

	 Btw, this was huge work, bugs is possible.

2006-03-16 [ver 1.11]
 81. Now in prewar weapon ammo show which damage u take and health show which damage u give,
	 armor show horizontal speed, but show speed u must activate via /kinfo kf 64

	 done by VVD.

 82. VVD added really nice feature, as u know aliases with params supported by ezQuake only,
	 fuhQuake, mqwcl and Zquake does't support such aliases. So VVD made trik.
	 I show u example with /admin command which have one optional parammeter.

	 I'm use "/admin CoolPass" in ezQuake, but how about fuhQuake and other clients?
	 U must use "/cmd cc admin CoolPass" in this cases, this must work in any client.

 83. Also VVD added "/pos_set_angles" and "/pos_set_origin" commands, but this commands 
	 need to be tweaked a bit.

 84. Fixed small frags bug with show speed code.

2006-03-14 [ver 1.10]
 79. /scores extended a bit.

 80. gl an rl suicide death msgs bug fix, thx gLAd.

2006-03-12 [ver 1.09]
 76. Added cvar "k_motd_time".

	 set k_motd_time 5 // set motd time to 5 seconds

	 U can't turn off motd completely, at least one second.

 77. Added /motd command - just show motd.

 78. Fixed /pos_move angles bug, VVD bug report.

2006-03-11 [ver 1.08]
 74. Fixed spawn code, thx wit'ka and gLAd.

 75. /scores fix. No teams in duel.

2006-03-10 [ver 1.07]
 73. /admin command extended. Now u can supply one argumment which will be treated 
	 as admin password.

	 /admin [pass]

	 So, if u does't supply pass, mod will ask about pass via impulses, 
	 but if u supply a valid pass mod will grant admin rights immediatelly.

	 NOTE: extension will work if u use ezQuake.

2006-03-09 [ver 1.06]
 72. Now tele spawn at map "end" is removed, if u dislike this u can turn this off with
	 cvar "k_end_tele_spawn".

	 set k_end_tele_spawn 0 // 0 - remove tele spawn at level "end"
					   		// 1 - don't remove

2006-03-08
 69. /rpickup formula changed, thx uzhas.

 70. noweapon info in countdown.

 71. Weapon ammo and megahealth does't present in dmm4 now - like in ktpro.

2006-03-07
 68. No "you are not allowed to fire" during countdown.

2006-03-06 [ver 1.05]
 65. Server localinfo k_maxrate and localinfo k_minrate worked now even in prewar too.
	 gLAd bug report.

 66. Small fix for lg, wanna belive this is a last.

 67. /pos_move is tweaked, position occupation is calculated much better, u can't stuck
	 in plats doors and etc now. With ktpro u can, and this is bad :P

2006-03-05 [ver 1.04]
 63. Probably I fixed spec wizard bug, I made some fix for mod and mvdsv. (require latest mvdsv)

 64. Added players commands:

	 /pos_save [number]
	 /pos_move [number]
	 /pos_show [number]

	 Where number is from 1 to 5 and interpreted as position slot, number is optional,
	 if u omit number it will be set to 1, i.e. first position slot.

	 This commands is generally like it was in ktpro.

	 Command "pos_save" - save player position, so u can restore it later with "pos_move",
	 angles and velocity also saved.

	 Command "pos_move" - move player to the position previously stored via "pos_save".

	 Command "pos_show" - just show some info about saved position, and also about player current
	 position.

	 Trixers must be happy.

	 Commands in KTX implemented by VVD, i've just tune this out.

2006-03-04 [ver 1.03]
 61. Added printing some mod/server info when connect to server. (require latest mvdsv)

 62. Removed localinfo "tp_players_stats". Advanced statistics shown always.

2006-03-03
 57. Fixed lg and plate bug again.

 58. /shownick is shown in prewar - but just player name or nick.

 59. "Was telefragged" and "sucides" messages does't shown in prewar now.

 60. Mod set proper maxclients on XonX commands, thx gLAd.

2006-03-02 [ver 1.02]
 55. Heh, fixed lg code from ID-style to ktpro-style.
     With ID lg u can hit few tragets(nearby) via one shot (cell).
	 With ktpro lg u can hit only one target per shot.

	 U _can't_ switch this via some localinfo or etc, we does't want holly war. :(

 56. setinfo "wps" moved to kinfo.

2006-02-26
 53. Fixed my +scores bug.

 54. Added next spec commands, generally like in ktpro (c).:
	 /autotrack
	 /auto_pow
	 /next_best
	 /next_pow

	 With "autotrack", KTX will switch the view to the "mod gueesed best player".

	 With "auto_pow" command mod does automatically switch
     to the player which took a powerup. The powerups have the following
     priority: pent, quad, eyes. So if auto_pow switched to a player
     which took pent and the pent runs out, the mod switches to one of
     the other powerups, e.g. quad, or (if there isn't another one) it
     will stay on the current player.	 

	 With "next_best" mod will switch your view between best and second-best player.
	 KTX tries to determine the best player by checking which powerups or weapons the players
	 have. In detail the procedure works like this: for every player the following 
     calculation is made: the mod checks whether the player meets certain criteria 
     and then adds up the values associated with each matching criterion as well as 
     his current fragcount. The two players with the highest result will be considered 
     best and second-best player. Here is a list of the values associated with each 
     criterion:

	 Pentagram of Protection     3000
     Quad Damage                 2000
     any other Powerup           2000
     Rocket Launcher with ammo   1000
     Lightning Gun with ammo      500
     Grenade Launcher with ammo   200
	 Super Nailgun with ammo      100
     Super Shotgun with ammo       50
     
     For example if a player has Quad Damage, the rocket launcher and 30 frags KTX 
     will calculate 2000 + 1000 + 30 = 3030 for him. A player with Pentagram and 40 frags
     would have a score of 3000 + 40 = 3040 and would thus be considered a better player
	 and the mod would switch to him first (unless another player on the server has an 
     even higher score). If the 2 players mentioned before are the players with the highest
     scores on the server, you could use the command "next_best" to switch between those
     two players.

	 About "next_pow". If there is a poweruped player, this will switch your view between
	 players until a poweruped player has been found.     
     
2006-02-12
 50. Added +scores command, generally like in ktpro (c).

	 This will permanently display how much time is left, as well as how many frags
	 each team has and the difference between them (the frags of the team of the
     player you are observing are shown as t: , the opponent's frags as e: , the
	 difference between his and the opponent's team frags is shown in brackets.
	 You can also bind +scores to a key, so that the remaining time as well as the
	 scores are only displayed while pressing the key, ktpro (c).

	 ffa ans duel mode support +scores too.

     "ls" key (for cmd info) is now supported.

 51. "ls", "lw", "ln" keys (for cmd info) now support negative values, but
	 if u use ezQuake u may prefer use "scr_centershift" cvar instead.

 52. Added version stuff.

	 Version now showed in MOTD, /about command and serverinfo as two keys: xmod and xbuild.
	 Build number also showed in /about command.

2006-02-04
 49. Added spec features:
	 /fav1_add ... /fav20_add
	 /1fav_go ...  /20fav_go
	 /fav_add
	 /fav_del
	 /fav_all_del
	 /fav_next
	 /fav_show

	 With the commands "fav1_add", "fav2_add", ... , "fav20_add" you can add the 
	 player you are currently spectating to the favorite player slot with the
	 specified number. For example issueing the "fav2_add" command will cause the
	 player you are currently spectating to be added to slot number 2. You can 
	 later switch to those players with the "1fav_go", "2fav_go", ... , "20fav_go"
	 commands.

	 With the "fav_add" command you can add one or several players to a favorite's 
	 list. This is done by issueing the commmand "fav_add" while spectating the 
	 desired player. You will then be able to switch between your favorites players 
	 with the the "fav_next" command.

	 With the "fav_del" command u will remove the player you are currently spectating from your
	 favorite's list (if he was in the list).

	 With the "fav_all_del" command u will remove all players that were in your favorite's list.

 	 Above commands is ktpro (c).

	 With "fav_show" command u can list your favorite's list.

	 NOTES: fav_next called in ktpro as next_fav, in ktx next_fav is alias for fav_next,
			added for back compatibility.

	 Oh, and HUGE thx goes to SD-Angel, who brings to me client /track command,
     does't know about this command before :(

2006-01-30
 48. As addon to voting.
     /rpickup command does't need admin rights now, but admin has veto rights.

	 set k_vp_rpickup  51   // votes percentage for random pickup voting

	 /whovote tuned too.

	 NOTES: /rpickup needs at least 4 votes, excepting admin veto.

2006-01-27
 47. Ok, i rewrote voting code.
	 Added particular voting percentage for most votings/election:

	 set k_vp_break   51   // votes percentage for stopping the match voting
	 set k_vp_admin   51   // votes percentage for admin election
	 set k_vp_captain 51   // votes percentage for captain election
	 set k_vp_map     51   // votes percentage for map change voting
	 set k_vp_pickup  51   // votes percentage for pickup voting
	
	 I must notice, percantage is bounded internally between 51% to 100%, so u can
	 set percentage to 30% but mod bound it to 51%, if this is wrong - let me know.

	 Election voting (captain or admin) need at least two votes.

	 Map voting is blocked for short time after map change, so all players have chance reconnect
	 and make they choice.

	 Regarding matchless mode, u can vote for map change now in game, not in intermission only.

	 I tune /whovote command output for our needs, and u can use it in matchless mode too.
	                                                                                         04
	 For /pickup /break commands required votes showed as (2) - this mean 2 more votes required.

2006-01-13
 45. +wp_stats working for specs too, like in ktpro.

 46. Fixed wizard bug, wizard model track player behind then map is changed, but u need
 	 latest mvdsv too, mvdsv will be patched too.

2006-01-09
 44. I rewrote MOTD a bit, as result up to 15 k_motd localinfos supported.
	 I mean u can use:
	 
	 localinfo k_motd1  "motd line 1"
	 localinfo k_motd2  "motd line 2"
	 ...
	 localinfo k_motd15 "motd line 15"

2006-01-06
 43. /fpslist command. ktpro (c)

	 Displays a list of the maximum, minimum and average FPS of the players on the server.

	 Statistic is cleared/acummulated every 15 seconds for each player.

2006-01-04
 40. If u customize +wp_stats to show rl or lg they will be shown even effectiveness is zero,
	 other weapons will not shown untill u get some non zero effectiveness.

 41. Rewrote a bit ready/break code. So, if u play non team game no more messages like:
	 "xxx more teams required" or "Get rid of xxx teams!\n" and about members in each team.

	 Set some reasonable values for this localinfos: k_membercount, k_lockmin, k_lockmax
	 if u issue XonX command.

 42. /tracklist command. ktpro (c)

	 This will display a list of which player (if any) the specs are observing.

	 Command work for specs and players.

2006-01-02
 37. Added coundtown in matchless mode.

	 set k_matchless_countdown 1 // use or not auto countdown in match less mode.
							     // countdown start right after map change.
							     // this help us wait some time, while players reconnect
								 // and load some data from HDD etc...
							     // so all players start in equal condition.
								 // set this to 0 if u dislike this.

	 NOTES: U can't stop this countdown alone.

 38. Added 'localinfo demo_skip_ktffa_record'. ktpro (c)
	 WARNING: now ffa demos can be autorecorded too, u can control this:

	 localinfo demo_skip_ktffa_record 1 // 1 - skip recording ffa demos
									    // 0 - does't skip

 39. MOTD now shown if u connect somewhere in the middle of the game in matchless mode.
     MOTD shown only one time in matchless mode, this is less annoying.

2006-01-01
 35. Added cvar 'allow_spec_wizard'. ktpro (c)
	 Spectators may be represented for players as wizards.

	 set allow_spec_wizard 2 // 0 - wizards not allowed
							 // 1 - allowed without players in prematch
                        	 // 2 - allowed with players in prematch

 36. Added wizard animation, u can control this:
	 set k_no_wizard_animation 0 // 0 - allows wizards to be animated
						    	 // 1 - disallow

2005-12-31
 34. Added dynamic powerups manipulation in matchless mode, depending on count of players.

	 set k_pow_min_players 3 // this is a count of players required for powerups to be on.
							 // for example if u set this to 3 - mod will disable powerups if 
							 // count of players less when 3.
							 // setting to 0 will disable this feature.
							 // NOTES: 1) only matchless mode affected by this setting
							 //        2) if 'k_pow' set to 0, powerups will be disabled anyway
							 //        3) already tooked powerups does't affected

	 set k_pow_check_time  10 // this just tell mode check 'k_pow_min_players' not every second
						 	  // but time which u desire, time in seconds, default is 10 seconds.

	 Happy new year :)

2005-12-29
 33. Fixed a bug where some tech info goes to client wheh XonX commands issued,
	 but u need the latest mvdsv.
     I dislike this fix because this fix can't help us in 100% cases, but this is lack of API.

2005-12-27
 32. Modified quote from ktpro docs.

	 In addition to the client-server setinfos you can now set most of
     such info via KTX. Advantages hereby: no setinfo overflows (or
     eyes/pmodel mismatch) and other players wont get flooded on info
     changes.
     
     syntax: cmd info [<key> [value]]      ' for setting info
             cmd uinfo <id/name> [key]     ' for reading others info (id from klist)

     On connect to the server (i.e. once) the alias 'infoset' will be called
     for players, and 'sinfoset' for spectators.

     ATTENTION, some old setinfos cannot be used with this new method! It's
     mainly for the info used by the mod itself and some additional stuff.
     
     Strictly forbidden values:

      bottomcolor
      name
      noaim
      rate
      skin
      spectator
      team
      topcolor

     Allowed values (and only this! Not yet supported values marked with // ):

		"b_switch"
	// 		bw
    //      b1, b2, b3, b4

    //   	ma		 wtf?
		"ss"
	//		rb
    	"w_switch"
		"k_sdir"

	NOTES: 1) ezQuake users have bonus, they can use 'kinfo' and 'kuinfo' instead of
		   'cmd info' and 'cmd uinfo' respectively.
		   Example:
			'kinfo' will show all u's keys.
			'kinfo b_switch' will show b_switch key.
			'kinfo b_switch 1' will set b_switch key to value of 1.

		   2) meaning of keys may differ from ktpro.

 29. Fixed my'n bug where ghost is not saved after u type disconnect at client console.

 30. gl direct hits is now showed in end match statistics.

 31. Added 'k_srvcfgmap', like it was in ktpro, this cvar just allow per map configuration.
	 If 'k_srvcfgmap' set to 1 then

	 set k_srvcfgmap 1
	
		exec configs/maps/out/mapname.cfg on leaving a map
		exec configs/maps/default.cfg on enter a map (all maps)
		exec configs/maps/mapname.cfg on enter a map

 27. Dropped quad now glow.

	 requested from me / gLAd / disc

 28. I changed a print level of message when quad/ring dropped/tooked, so players who
	 does't sow pickup messages catch this message. I talk about rules where quad or
     ring is dropable, and took message goes from dropped item, not from normally respawned item.

	 requested from gLAd / disc

2005-12-21
 25. Added 'noweapon [weaponName]' command, wich disallow/allow particular weapon
	 in dmm4 and only dmm4.

	 Weaponname may be: axe sg ssg ng sng gl rl lg.
	 Without params 'noweapon' just show info.

	 Appropriate server cvar:

	 worked like fpd, i.e. sum of this values
	
	 set k_disallow_weapons 16 //  4096 AXE
							   //     1 SHOTGUN
							   //     2 SUPER_SHOTGUN
							   //     4 NAILGUN
							   //     8 SUPER_NAILGUN
							   //    16 GRENADE_LAUNCHER
							   //    32 ROCKET_LAUNCHER
							   //    64 LIGHTNING

	 'set k_disallow_weapons 16' - just disallow gl in dmm4, this is
	 by default if u type XonX command.

	 NOTES: 'noweapon' command is actually an alias, but alias with params, so this is
            worked ok only on ezQuake.

 26. fixed BUG: break;reconnect;break... --> map changed
	 gLAd noticed me.

2005-12-16
 24. Added handicap support. 'klist' will show it now.

     You can now set a handicap for yourself. Just use 'handicap' to
     toggle through the possibilities.

     A 75% handicap would mean, that your weapons(and only weapons) would do only
     75% of their normal damage. So if you play a newbie and don't
     want to rape him -- while playing normal tho --, this is for you.

	 NOTES: 
	 	No difference is this teammate or not for handicap.
	 	U get full damage from self even u use handicap.
		U can set handicap in intermission in matchless mode.
		U can set particular value of handicap via 'handicap' [value]
			e.g. 'handicap 66' set handicap to 66%, but this is work on ezQuake only.

     'hdptoggle' command added (toggle allow handicap)
     in server.cfg u can lock it using 'k_lock_hdp'

	 set k_lock_hdp 0 // 0 - allow handicap
					  // 1 - disalow

2005-12-10
 22. Remooved some spectator stuff, mostly retard with new servers.
	 Only one impulse left for spectator, impulse 1, just move between spawn points on the map,
	 u must not track someone in this case.

 23. Added 'klist' command, like ktpro. Just show some information about all players and
	 spectators.

	 Show: id (same as server), vip number, admin status, handicap (currently unsupported),
		   player name, player team, also for spectator we show which player he track, if any.

2005-12-09
 21. Map changing is changed.

     If u set 'samelvel' native server cvar to 1 then level will not changed, 
	 but with map voting u can still change map.

	 Changelevel triggers will _not_ change map in anycase, just do huge damage.

	 WARNING: map list syntax is changed
	 	qqshka, i modified this, so if someone select map not in map list and match is ended
	 	we will select some map from map list, nor just stay on current map.
	 	map list have now next syntax:
	 	localinfo k_ml_0 dm6
	 	localinfo k_ml_1 dm4
	 	localinfo k_ml_2 dm2
	 	so this mean we have rotation of maps dm6 dm4 dm2 dm6 dm4 dm2 ...


2005-12-04
 20. Added 'kfjump' and 'krjump' commands. Also added 'tkfjump' and 'trfjump',
	 which just toggle allowances of first pair of commands.
	 By default commands is allowed.
	 Added new cvars:

	 set k_disallow_kfjump 0 // 0 allow kfjump
							 // 1 disallow

	 set k_disallow_krjump 0 // 0 allow krjump
							 // 1 disallow

	 krjump differs from Ktpro version. Ktpro version force centerview, imo this is bad idea
	 because u lost orientation for a moment. Anyway u can use client aliases like this:

	 	alias ktpro_krjump "krjump; centerview"

	 if u really need it.

2005-12-02
 18. Added 'k_matchless' which force mod run as ordynary FFA server.

	 set k_matchless 1 // 1 - mod run as FFA server (Matchless mode)
	                   // 0 - mod run as usual (Match mode)

	 No admins for now in matchless mode.
	 Valid commands can be obtained via 'commands' command :]

	 NOTES: Plz, set teamplay to 0 and k_mode to 3 in server.cfg in matchless mode,
			but mod fix this anyway.
	        No overtime in matchless mode.
			U can vote for mapchange via 'break' command.
			U can vote for mapchange in intermission, hehe.

 19. Fixed my bug where overtime stats does't saved actual and does't show at match end.

2005-11-23
 17. Countdown printing is look better now.
	
2005-11-21
 16. I clear some things. Mod in source code have not some standard way to determine
	 which game type is(tp, duel, ffa), mod check 'teamplay' cvar, 'k_duel' localinfo,
	 count of players and  count of teams, this is complicated and wrong, so I remove 'k_duel'
	 and introduce 'k_mode' user created cvar (via 'set' command at the servers cfgs) which
	 help me unambiguously get current game type.
	 Usermodes commands like XonX and ffa already have appropriate values(internally), so does't
	 put this cvar in configs/usermodes/XonX/*.cfg's.
	 Generally u may forget about this 'k_mode', just put it in server.cfg or whatever.

	 set k_mode 2 // 0 - unknown, mode will try to find appropriate value,
				  //     do not relay on this.
				  // 1 - duel
				  // 2 - team
				  // 3 - ffa

	 U must understand what 'k_mode' and 'teamplay' linkage somehow.

	 I provide example configuration files in future, so this will be much transparent.

2005-11-13
 13. Ok, information after match contain not less statistics than Ktpro now, 
	 added megahealth stats.

	 Spawnfrags, this then u kill somebody with weapon( stomped is exception :] ) and
	 this somebody was spawned less than second before, mates is not counted as spawnfrags.

	 Players statiscics doesn't contain some advanced information in teamplay mode,
	 but u can control this via:

		localinfo tp_players_stats		1
  						// 0 - doesn't show
		   				// 1 - show some advanced information in players statistics
		   				//     after match is over, like items, damage taken and given.
		   				//     only teamplay modes affected by this setting, 
		   				//     non teamplay modes show this info anyway.

 14. fixed dm6 and lg plate bug, does't work in QVM :]

 15. Some bugfixes.

2005-10-23
 11. Added wp_reset command which reset weapons stats :)
	 Did't work after match start.

 12. Information after match is much more like ktpro now.

2005-10-21
 10. Added +wp_stats command, which show how effectively u use weapons.
	 Eff calculated like 100 * hits / AllShots, except gl and rl for which calculated
	 just direct hits.

	 Use 'lw' setinfo to change the position of the command.

     Using 'wps' setinfo u can customize which weapons u want to be displayed:
	  	  1 - axe
	  	  2 - sg
	  	  4 - ssg
	  	  8 - ng
	 	 16 - sng
	 	 32 - gl
	 	 64 - rl
		128 - lg
	 So if u want only rl + lg u must set 'wps' to 192 ( 64 + 128 ).

	 If 'wps' is not specified or 0 then rl + lg + gl will be displayed.

	 Oh, and weapons splitted in groups, rl + lg + gl is first line, axe + sg + ssg is second
	 and ng + sng is last line. So if u set 'wps' to show rl + axe then +wp_stats will show
	 two lines.

2005-09-26
 8. practice mode, quote from ktpro
	localinfo srv_practice_mode		0

	localinfo lock_practice         0  //0 - no lock (after last client disconnect from server
                                       //server will return to no practice mode
                                       //1 - normal lock - every one with properly rights
                                       //(from allow_toggle_practice) can turn off practice mode
                                       //2 - server is locked in practice mode

	localinfo allow_toggle_practice 5  //0 - noone, 1 - admins, 2 elected admins too
                                   	   //3 - only real real judges, 4 - elected judges too
                                       //5 - all players

 9. fixed qw or kteams bug where some sounds may instantly canceled (overwriten via others)
    I'm not check all code, just what i found.

2005-09-12
 7. i changed a bit k_freeze localinfo, so if 'localinfo k_freeze 1' this let us
	freeze level _right_ after level spawn, in native Kteams or ktpro trains or plats
    will move one time,	even k_freeze is set

2005-09-09
 6. mmm, quote from ktpro
	//aerowalk map support 
	//imo it is greatest map for 1/1, maybe with quad it will be also good for 2/2 ?:)
	localinfo add_q_aerowalk 1 //adds quad on aerowalk

2005-09-06
 3. mostly added ktpro timing feature

	//timing/full laged players manipulation
	localinfo allow_timing 1         //allow modside manipulatuion
	localinfo timing_players_time 1  //6 seconds default

	localinfo timing_players_action 3   //only info and glow
                                  		//bit mask - you must add values to define proper action
                                  		//1 - info, 2 - glow, 4 - invincible, 8 - autokpause
                                  		//so if you want make invincible and glow 
                                  		//it should be: 2 + 4 = 6

	TODO: check code about client connect during mod is paused i.e. k_pause != 0

 	->s.v.nextthink trouble

 4. localinfo k_remove_end_hurt 1 //remove hurt trigger on map end

 5. //mod can remove gibs after 2 seconds so players can not use gibs filter
	localinfo k_short_gib 1

2005-08-29
 1. added 'dmm1' 'dmm2' 'dmm3' 'dmm4' 'dmm5' command.
	'dm' is just show dmm.

	'dmm6' 'dmm7' 'dmm8' is unsupported!!!

 2.	heh, if u an admin, ktpro XonX usermode command
 	set localinfo k_fallbunny 0, always,
 	so I introduce 'k_umfallbunny', which is just control which value
 	must be set to 'k_fallbunny' after XonX (u are must be admin too).

2005-08-28 day
'official' command removed due to '4on4' existence

2005-08-28 night %)
added 1on1 2on2 3on3 4on4 10on10 and ffa commands

for example 1on1 on dm6 will setup some predefined stuff for this
command and exec this files:
	"exec configs/usermodes/default.cfg"
	"exec configs/usermodes/dm6.cfg"
	"exec configs/usermodes/1on1/default.cfg"
	"exec configs/usermodes/1on1/dm6.cfg"

and some localinfos

'k_free_mode'

for 1on1 / 2on2 / 4on4 and ffa commands manipulation
0 - noone, 1 - admins, 2 elected admins too
3 - only real real judges, 4 - elected judges too
5 - all players

hmm, I didn't understand how k_free_mode affect this commands in ktpro,
so implement how i think this must be, it is like some sort of access control

'k_allowed_free_modes'  //for possible 1on1 2on2 etc commands
//you have to add all needed values like in fpd for allowing what you want:
//1on1 = 1, 2on2 = 2, 3on3 = 4, 4on4 = 8, 10on10 = 16, ffa = 32
//localinfo k_allowed_free_modes 63 means that all modes are allowed
//63 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32

2005-08-27
all maps, even native eXmY dm1-dm6 start and end, uses `cmd cc <value>`, only
few impulse commands exist, like weapon changing and some spectator stuff.

TODO: remove latest impulses except weapon and so on.

better code for stuffing maps and commands

added setinfo 'ss' like in ktpro
quote from ktpro
ss - used to control the speed at which aliases are stuffed to you when connecting
--          to a KTeams Pro server, default value is 4 which means one alias every
            0.04 seconds, the smallest possible value is 1 and only integer values are 
            accepted
            
                     example: setinfo ss 1
                     
                     this will cause the server to stuff you one alias every 0.01 seconds

    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	if u don't know, u can use `check_maps` at server console for generating
	stuff like this in the server localinfo

	localinfo 1000 ukooldm1
	localinfo 1001 ukooldm2
	localinfo 1002 ukooldm3

	so u may not do this manually, just put this command some where
	in the server config file. Oh, and this is MVDSV feature.

	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

brokenankle worked now

TODO: it just blok +jump for one frame, so this can be ezly escaped via cheatish client,
	  so current implementation(Kteams 2.21 and i think ktpro too) is suck,
	  but as for me i prefer disable brokenankle at all
