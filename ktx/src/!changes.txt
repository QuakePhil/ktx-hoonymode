 13. Ok, information after match contain not less statistics than Ktpro now, 
	 added megahealth stats.

	 Spawnfrags, this then u kill somebody with weapon( stomped is exception :] ) and
	 this somebody was spawned less than second before, mates is not counted as spawnfrags.

	 Players statiscics doesn't contain some advanced information in teamplay mode,
	 but u can control this via:

		localinfo tp_players_stats		1
  						// 0 - doesn't show
		   				// 1 - show some advanced information in players statistics
		   				//     after match is over, like items, damage taken and given.
		   				//     only teamplay modes affected by this setting, 
		   				//     non teamplay modes show this info anyway.

 14. fixed dm6 and lg plate bug, does't work in QVM :]

 15. Some bugfixes.

 11. Added wp_reset command which reset weapons stats :)
	 Did't work after match start.

 12. Information after match is much more like ktpro now.

 10. Added +wp_stats command, which show how effectively u use weapons.
	 Eff calculated like 100 * hits / AllShots, except gl and rl for which calculated
	 just direct hits.

	 Use 'lw' setinfo to change the position of the command.

     Using 'wps' setinfo u can customize which weapons u want to be displayed:
	  	  1 - axe
	  	  2 - sg
	  	  4 - ssg
	  	  8 - ng
	 	 16 - sng
	 	 32 - gl
	 	 64 - rl
		128 - lg
	 So if u want only rl + lg u must set 'wps' to 192 ( 64 + 128 ).

	 If 'wps' is not specified or 0 then rl + lg + gl will be displayed.

	 Oh, and weapons splitted in groups, rl + lg + gl is first line, axe + sg + ssg is second
	 and ng + sng is last line. So if u set 'wps' to show rl + axe then +wp_stats will show
	 two lines.

 8. practice mode, quote from ktpro
	localinfo srv_practice_mode		0

	localinfo lock_practice         0  //0 - no lock (after last client disconnect from server
                                       //server will return to no practice mode
                                       //1 - normal lock - every one with properly rights
                                       //(from allow_toggle_practice) can turn off practice mode
                                       //2 - server is locked in practice mode

	localinfo allow_toggle_practice 5  //0 - noone, 1 - admins, 2 elected admins too
                                   	   //3 - only real real judges, 4 - elected judges too
                                       //5 - all players

 9. fixed qw or kteams bug where some sounds may instantly canceled (overwriten via others)
    I'm not check all code, just what i found.

2005-09-12
 7. i changed a bit k_freeze localinfo, so if 'localinfo k_freeze 1' this let us
	freeze level _right_ after level spawn, in native Kteams or ktpro trains or plats
    will move one time,	even k_freeze is set

2005-09-09
 6. mmm, quote from ktpro
	//aerowalk map support 
	//imo it is greatest map for 1/1, maybe with quad it will be also good for 2/2 ?:)
	localinfo add_q_aerowalk 1 //adds quad on aerowalk

2005-09-06
 3. mostly added ktpro timing feature

	//timing/full laged players manipulation
	localinfo allow_timing 1         //allow modside manipulatuion
	localinfo timing_players_time 1  //6 seconds default

	localinfo timing_players_action 3   //only info and glow
                                  		//bit mask - you must add values to define proper action
                                  		//1 - info, 2 - glow, 4 - invincible, 8 - autokpause
                                  		//so if you want make invincible and glow 
                                  		//it should be: 2 + 4 = 6

	TODO: check code about client connect during mod is paused i.e. k_pause != 0

 	->s.v.nextthink trouble

 4. localinfo k_remove_end_hurt 1 //remove hurt trigger on map end

 5. //mod can remove gibs after 2 seconds so players can not use gibs filter
	localinfo k_short_gib 1

2005-08-29
 1. added 'dmm1' 'dmm2' 'dmm3' 'dmm4' 'dmm5' command.
	'dm' is just show dmm.

	'dmm6' 'dmm7' 'dmm8' is unsupported!!!

 2.	heh, if u an admin, ktpro XonX usermode command
 	set localinfo k_fallbunny 0, always,
 	so I introduce 'k_umfallbunny', which is just control which value
 	must be set to 'k_fallbunny' after XonX (u are must be admin too).

2005-08-28 day
'official' command removed due to '4on4' existence

2005-08-28 night %)
added 1on1 2on2 3on3 4on4 10on10 and ffa commands

for example 1on1 on dm6 will setup some predefined stuff for this
command and exec this files:
	"exec configs/usermodes/default.cfg\n"
	"exec configs/usermodes/dm6.cfg\n"
	"exec configs/usermodes/1on1/default.cfg\n"
	"exec configs/usermodes/1on1/dm6.cfg\n"

and some localinfos

'k_free_mode'

for 1on1 / 2on2 / 4on4 and ffa commands manipulation
0 - noone, 1 - admins, 2 elected admins too
3 - only real real judges, 4 - elected judges too
5 - all players

hmm, I didn't understand how k_free_mode affect this commands in ktpro,
so implement how i think this must be, it is like some sort of access control

'k_allowed_free_modes'  //for possible 1on1 2on2 etc commands
//you have to add all needed values like in fpd for allowing what you want:
//1on1 = 1, 2on2 = 2, 3on3 = 4, 4on4 = 8, 10on10 = 16, ffa = 32
//localinfo k_allowed_free_modes 63 means that all modes are allowed
//63 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32

all maps, even native eXmY dm1-dm6 start and end, uses `cmd cc <value>`, only
few impulse commands exist, like weapon changing and some spectator stuff.

TODO: remove latest impulses except weapon and so on.

better code for stuffing maps and commands

added setinfo 'ss' like in ktpro
quote from ktpro
ss - used to control the speed at which aliases are stuffed to you when connecting
--          to a KTeams Pro server, default value is 4 which means one alias every
            0.04 seconds, the smallest possible value is 1 and only integer values are 
            accepted
            
                     example: setinfo ss 1
                     
                     this will cause the server to stuff you one alias every 0.01 seconds

    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	if u don't know, u can use `check_maps` at server console for generating
	stuff like this in the server localinfo

	localinfo 1000 ukooldm1
	localinfo 1001 ukooldm2
	localinfo 1002 ukooldm3

	so u may not do this manually, just put this command some where
	in the server config file. Oh, and this is MVDSV feature.

brokenankle worked now

TODO: it just blok +jump for one frame, so this can be ezly escaped via cheatish client,
	  so current implementation(Kteams 2.21 and i think ktpro too) is suck,
	  but as for me i prefer disable brokenankle at all
