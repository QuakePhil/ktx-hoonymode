 27. Dropped quad now glow.

	 requested from me / gLAd / disc

 28. I changed a print level of message when quad/ring dropped/tooked, so players who
	 does't sow pickup messages catch this message. I talk about rules where quad or
     ring is dropable, and took message goes from dropped item, not from normally respawned item.

	 requested from gLAd / disc

 25. Added 'noweapon [weaponName]' command, wich disallow/allow particular weapon
	 in dmm4 and only dmm4.

	 Weaponname may be: axe sg ssg ng sng gl rl lg.
	 Without params 'noweapon' just show info.

	 Appropriate server cvar:

	 worked like fpd, i.e. sum of this values
	
	 set k_disallow_weapons 16 //  4096 AXE
							   //     1 SHOTGUN
							   //     2 SUPER_SHOTGUN
							   //     4 NAILGUN
							   //     8 SUPER_NAILGUN
							   //    16 GRENADE_LAUNCHER
							   //    32 ROCKET_LAUNCHER
							   //    64 LIGHTNING

	 'set k_disallow_weapons 16' - just disallow gl in dmm4, this is
	 by default if u type XonX command.

	 NOTES: 'noweapon' command is actually an alias, but alias with params, so this is
            worked ok only on ezQauke.

 26. fixed BUG: break;reconnect;break... --> map changed
	 gLAd noticed me.

 24. Added handicap support. 'klist' will show it now.

     You can now set a handicap for yourself. Just use 'handicap' to
     toggle through the possibilities.

     A 75% handicap would mean, that your weapons(and only weapons) would do only
     75% of their normal damage. So if you play a newbie and don't
     want to rape him -- while playing normal tho --, this is for you.

	 NOTES: 
	 	No difference is this teammate or not for handicap.
	 	U get full damage from self even u use handicap.
		U can set handicap in intermission in matchless mode.
		U can set particular value of handicap via 'handicap' [value]
			e.g. 'handicap 66' set handicap to 66%, but this is work on ezQuake only.

     'hdptoggle' command added (toggle allow handicap)
     in server.cfg u can lock it using 'k_lock_hdp'

	 set k_lock_hdp 0 // 0 - allow handicap
					  // 1 - disalow

2005-12-10
 22. Remooved some spectator stuff, mostly retard with new servers.
	 Only one impulse left for spectator, impulse 1, just move between spawn points on the map,
	 u must not track someone in this case.

 23. Added 'klist' command, like ktpro. Just show some information about all players and
	 spectators.

	 Show: id (same as server), vip number, admin status, handicap (currently unsupported),
		   player name, player team, also for spectator we show which player he track, if any.

2005-12-09
 21. Map changing is changed.

     If u set 'samelvel' native server cvar to 1 then level will not changed, 
	 but with map voting u can still change map.

	 Changelevel triggers will _not_ change map in anycase, just do huge damage.

	 WARNING: map list syntax is changed
	 	qqshka, i modified this, so if someone select map not in map list and match is ended
	 	we will select some map from map list, nor just stay on current map.
	 	map list have now next syntax:
	 	localinfo k_ml_0 dm6
	 	localinfo k_ml_1 dm4
	 	localinfo k_ml_2 dm2
	 	so this mean we have rotation of maps dm6 dm4 dm2 dm6 dm4 dm2 ...


2005-12-04
 20. Added 'kfjump' and 'krjump' commands. Also added 'tkfjump' and 'trfjump',
	 which just toggle allowances of first pair of commands.
	 By default commands is allowed.
	 Added new cvars:

	 set k_disallow_kfjump 0 // 0 allow kfjump
							 // 1 disallow

	 set k_disallow_krjump 0 // 0 allow krjump
							 // 1 disallow

	 krjump differs from Ktpro version. Ktpro version force centerview, imo this is bad idea
	 because u lost orientation for a moment. Anyway u can use client aliases like this:

	 	alias ktpro_krjump "krjump; centerview"

	 if u really need it.

2005-12-02
 18. Added 'k_matchless' which force mod run as ordynary FFA server.

	 set k_matchless 1 // 1 - mod run as FFA server (Matchless mode)
	                   // 0 - mod run as usual (Match mode)

	 No admins for now in matchless mode.
	 Valid commands can be obtained via 'commands' command :]

	 NOTES: Plz, set teamplay to 0 and k_mode to 3 in server.cfg in matchless mode,
			but mod fix this anyway.
	        No overtime in matchless mode.
			U can vote for mapchange via 'break' command.
			U can vote for mapchange in intermission, hehe.

 19. Fixed my bug where overtime stats does't saved actual and does't show at match end.

2005-11-23
 17. Countdown printing is look better now.
	
2005-11-21
 16. I clear some things. Mod in source code have not some standard way to determine
	 which game type is(tp, duel, ffa), mod check 'teamplay' cvar, 'k_duel' localinfo,
	 count of players and  count of teams, this is complicated and wrong, so I remove 'k_duel'
	 and introduce 'k_mode' user created cvar (via 'set' command at the servers cfgs) which
	 help me unambiguously get current game type.
	 Usermodes commands like XonX and ffa already have appropriate values(internally), so does't
	 put this cvar in configs/usermodes/XonX/*.cfg's.
	 Generally u may forget about this 'k_mode', just put it in server.cfg or whatever.

	 set k_mode 2 // 0 - unknown, mode will try to find appropriate value,
				  //     do not relay on this.
				  // 1 - duel
				  // 2 - team
				  // 3 - ffa

	 U must understand what 'k_mode' and 'teamplay' linkage somehow.

	 I provide example configuration files in future, so this will be much transparent.

2005-11-13
 13. Ok, information after match contain not less statistics than Ktpro now, 
	 added megahealth stats.

	 Spawnfrags, this then u kill somebody with weapon( stomped is exception :] ) and
	 this somebody was spawned less than second before, mates is not counted as spawnfrags.

	 Players statiscics doesn't contain some advanced information in teamplay mode,
	 but u can control this via:

		localinfo tp_players_stats		1
  						// 0 - doesn't show
		   				// 1 - show some advanced information in players statistics
		   				//     after match is over, like items, damage taken and given.
		   				//     only teamplay modes affected by this setting, 
		   				//     non teamplay modes show this info anyway.

 14. fixed dm6 and lg plate bug, does't work in QVM :]

 15. Some bugfixes.

2005-10-23
 11. Added wp_reset command which reset weapons stats :)
	 Did't work after match start.

 12. Information after match is much more like ktpro now.

2005-10-21
 10. Added +wp_stats command, which show how effectively u use weapons.
	 Eff calculated like 100 * hits / AllShots, except gl and rl for which calculated
	 just direct hits.

	 Use 'lw' setinfo to change the position of the command.

     Using 'wps' setinfo u can customize which weapons u want to be displayed:
	  	  1 - axe
	  	  2 - sg
	  	  4 - ssg
	  	  8 - ng
	 	 16 - sng
	 	 32 - gl
	 	 64 - rl
		128 - lg
	 So if u want only rl + lg u must set 'wps' to 192 ( 64 + 128 ).

	 If 'wps' is not specified or 0 then rl + lg + gl will be displayed.

	 Oh, and weapons splitted in groups, rl + lg + gl is first line, axe + sg + ssg is second
	 and ng + sng is last line. So if u set 'wps' to show rl + axe then +wp_stats will show
	 two lines.

 8. practice mode, quote from ktpro
	localinfo srv_practice_mode		0

	localinfo lock_practice         0  //0 - no lock (after last client disconnect from server
                                       //server will return to no practice mode
                                       //1 - normal lock - every one with properly rights
                                       //(from allow_toggle_practice) can turn off practice mode
                                       //2 - server is locked in practice mode

	localinfo allow_toggle_practice 5  //0 - noone, 1 - admins, 2 elected admins too
                                   	   //3 - only real real judges, 4 - elected judges too
                                       //5 - all players

 9. fixed qw or kteams bug where some sounds may instantly canceled (overwriten via others)
    I'm not check all code, just what i found.

2005-09-12
 7. i changed a bit k_freeze localinfo, so if 'localinfo k_freeze 1' this let us
	freeze level _right_ after level spawn, in native Kteams or ktpro trains or plats
    will move one time,	even k_freeze is set

2005-09-09
 6. mmm, quote from ktpro
	//aerowalk map support 
	//imo it is greatest map for 1/1, maybe with quad it will be also good for 2/2 ?:)
	localinfo add_q_aerowalk 1 //adds quad on aerowalk

2005-09-06
 3. mostly added ktpro timing feature

	//timing/full laged players manipulation
	localinfo allow_timing 1         //allow modside manipulatuion
	localinfo timing_players_time 1  //6 seconds default

	localinfo timing_players_action 3   //only info and glow
                                  		//bit mask - you must add values to define proper action
                                  		//1 - info, 2 - glow, 4 - invincible, 8 - autokpause
                                  		//so if you want make invincible and glow 
                                  		//it should be: 2 + 4 = 6

	TODO: check code about client connect during mod is paused i.e. k_pause != 0

 	->s.v.nextthink trouble

 4. localinfo k_remove_end_hurt 1 //remove hurt trigger on map end

 5. //mod can remove gibs after 2 seconds so players can not use gibs filter
	localinfo k_short_gib 1

2005-08-29
 1. added 'dmm1' 'dmm2' 'dmm3' 'dmm4' 'dmm5' command.
	'dm' is just show dmm.

	'dmm6' 'dmm7' 'dmm8' is unsupported!!!

 2.	heh, if u an admin, ktpro XonX usermode command
 	set localinfo k_fallbunny 0, always,
 	so I introduce 'k_umfallbunny', which is just control which value
 	must be set to 'k_fallbunny' after XonX (u are must be admin too).

2005-08-28 day
'official' command removed due to '4on4' existence

2005-08-28 night %)
added 1on1 2on2 3on3 4on4 10on10 and ffa commands

for example 1on1 on dm6 will setup some predefined stuff for this
command and exec this files:
	"exec configs/usermodes/default.cfg\n"
	"exec configs/usermodes/dm6.cfg\n"
	"exec configs/usermodes/1on1/default.cfg\n"
	"exec configs/usermodes/1on1/dm6.cfg\n"

and some localinfos

'k_free_mode'

for 1on1 / 2on2 / 4on4 and ffa commands manipulation
0 - noone, 1 - admins, 2 elected admins too
3 - only real real judges, 4 - elected judges too
5 - all players

hmm, I didn't understand how k_free_mode affect this commands in ktpro,
so implement how i think this must be, it is like some sort of access control

'k_allowed_free_modes'  //for possible 1on1 2on2 etc commands
//you have to add all needed values like in fpd for allowing what you want:
//1on1 = 1, 2on2 = 2, 3on3 = 4, 4on4 = 8, 10on10 = 16, ffa = 32
//localinfo k_allowed_free_modes 63 means that all modes are allowed
//63 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32

2005-08-27
all maps, even native eXmY dm1-dm6 start and end, uses `cmd cc <value>`, only
few impulse commands exist, like weapon changing and some spectator stuff.

TODO: remove latest impulses except weapon and so on.

better code for stuffing maps and commands

added setinfo 'ss' like in ktpro
quote from ktpro
ss - used to control the speed at which aliases are stuffed to you when connecting
--          to a KTeams Pro server, default value is 4 which means one alias every
            0.04 seconds, the smallest possible value is 1 and only integer values are 
            accepted
            
                     example: setinfo ss 1
                     
                     this will cause the server to stuff you one alias every 0.01 seconds

    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	if u don't know, u can use `check_maps` at server console for generating
	stuff like this in the server localinfo

	localinfo 1000 ukooldm1
	localinfo 1001 ukooldm2
	localinfo 1002 ukooldm3

	so u may not do this manually, just put this command some where
	in the server config file. Oh, and this is MVDSV feature.

	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

brokenankle worked now

TODO: it just blok +jump for one frame, so this can be ezly escaped via cheatish client,
	  so current implementation(Kteams 2.21 and i think ktpro too) is suck,
	  but as for me i prefer disable brokenankle at all
